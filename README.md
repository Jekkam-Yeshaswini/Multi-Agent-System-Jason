# Multi-Agent-System-Jason
The repository consists of an implementation of a simple MAS (Multi-Agent System) using AgentSpeak executable on Jason-Java based interpreter. 

The MAS implementation is a telephonic conversation between a doctor and a patient.
Scenario is that of a helpline for concerned people with coronavirus symptoms during pandemic.

**NOTE: For detailed scenario and implementation of the MAS is read the Write_up.pdf file.

In the 'add percept' window,
 	1st text field is for the agents name.
	2nd text field is for the percept.

The default percept is query(symptoms). And this argument is better left to remain constant through out while looking at different variations of the simulation

Agents in the system:
	1. Doctor -> emma (Not designed to be usable through the window)
	2. Patient -> elsa, anna , john (Passing this through the window will return the different versions of the program that start with differnt initial belief base.)
